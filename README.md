# 📺 YouTube RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to interact with YouTube videos through intelligent question answering. The system extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, indexes them in a vector database, and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer user queries contextually.
